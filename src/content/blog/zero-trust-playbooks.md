Zero trust principles are mature, but translating them into day-to-day guardrails remains challengingâ€”especially when your estate spans managed Kubernetes, critical SaaS providers, and a legacy data center that cannot be retired.

At BastCo we standardize on three playbooks that scale with clients of any size:

1. **Strong identity signals everywhere.** We integrate workload, user, and device identity into the same policy engine so that risky signals can short-circuit access early. This means enforcing WebAuthn for engineers *and* signed workload identities for services that call each other.
2. **Network segmentation as a safety net, not a crutch.** Software-defined perimeters and cloud-native micro-segmentation reduce the blast radius when credentials leak. We default to deny and only open explicit pathways with time-boxed approvals.
3. **Runtime enforcement backed by telemetry.** Every policy decision needs a log that describes the request, attributes considered, and outcome. Without this, post-incident investigations stall.

Adopting these playbooks unlocks a meaningful reduction in lateral movement risk. Over the next few weeks we will publish implementation guides and Terraform modules to accelerate your rollout.
